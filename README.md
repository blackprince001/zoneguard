# Zoneguard

An IP Geolocator and basic Firewall.

`./data.csv` can be downloaded here - https://lite.ip2location.com/ip2location-lite?lang=en_US. (IP2Locationâ„¢ LITE IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE Database)

We would extract the latitudes and longitudes of the ip-addresses to find the location of the user and if it is within a zone configured to this system, it would be flagged, better off restricted.
